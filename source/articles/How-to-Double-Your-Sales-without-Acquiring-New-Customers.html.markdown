<b>How to Double Your Sales without Acquiring New Customers</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To grow a store's revenue, most business owners think they need to acquire new customers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They would be right; more customers does equal more revenue, but is it the easiest way to double your sales?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three things that every e-commerce business can do to double, triple, or quadruple their revenue. They are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Increase a customer's average order value (AOV)</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Increase a customer's average purchase frequency</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(APF)</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Acquire new customers </span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Current customers are </span><a href="https://blog.smile.io/repeat-customers-profitable-stats-to-prove" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine times more likely to reorder than a first time buyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-247" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-1-1.png" alt="" width="674" height="158" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing your customers' average order value and average purchase frequency</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is not only cheaper through email marketing, but also several times </span><a href="https://www.smartrmail.com/blog/should-my-store-send-daily-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more profitable than customer acquisition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-246" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-2.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="479" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/actonsoftware/act-on-marketing-automation-beyond-customer-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A store's primary goal should be to focus on retention first and then acquisition later. </span>

Once you have your AOV and APF email setup and optimized, then it's time to refocus the shift to customer acquisition, not the other way around.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply increasing your AOV and APF by 40% (which is low if you currently have no AOV/APF strategies in place) can have a huge impact on your revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me give you an idea of what a 40% increase would do for a business:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 (average order value) x 2 (average purchase frequency per 365 days) x 500 (customers) = $100,000 </span>

If we increase the AOV and APF by 40%, you get the following:<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$140 (average order value) x 2.8 (average purchase frequency per 365 days) x 500 (customers) = $196,000</span>

That's a 96% increase in revenue per year without having to acquire a single new customer.

<b>
</b><b>Calculating your average order value (AOV)</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can start to increase your AOV, you need to find out your current AOV to use as a benchmark.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a simple calculation: as follows:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average order value = total revenue / total orders</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your total revenue for the last 365-day period was $50,000 from a total of 268 orders, your AOV is $186.56 (50,000/268).</span>

This is the most basic way to calculate AOV. You can also add your cost margins to find your net AOV.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Calculating your average purchase frequency (APF)</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out your APF is just as easy. You need to calculate two things:</span>

<b>Average purchase frequency</b> <b>=</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> total orders / unique customers</span>

For example, if you receive 268 orders (in a 365-day period) from a total of 42 customers, your average purchase frequency is 6.3 (268/42) orders per customer per year.

<b>Average time between purchases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> = 365 days / average purchase frequency</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With 6.3 orders per year, if we divide that by 365 days, a customer orders every 57 days, on average.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why it's important to know your average purchase frequency is so you don't bombard your customers with too many or too few emails. Based on your store's APF, you'll be able to gauge </span><a href="https://www.smartrmail.com/blog/how-to-determine-your-stores-optimal-email-frequency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how many emails you need to send your customers each month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's a great starting point to use:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-245" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-3-1024x252.png" alt="" width="1024" height="252" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So now you have calculated these two important metrics, here is how you can use a few emails to increase your store's revenue through email marketing without having to acquire new customers.</span>

<b>Cross-sells and up-sells</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-sell and upsell emails are the bread and butter of increasing AOV and APF for all businesses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've ever bought a car from a dealership, the mats, leather seats, and USB add-ons are what are known as cross-sells and up-sells.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An up-sell is an upgrade to the current item the customers are viewing. For example, going from a regular meal to a large meal at McDonald's is considered an up-sell.</span>

A cross-sell is when customers are shown complementary items to the core product. It’s the classic: “Would you like fries with that?”.

You can apply cross-sells and upsells to your e-commerce store through email marketing based on a customer's purchase history.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Dollar Shave Club's email below offers a cross-sell for a customer that has just purchased The Executive Cartridges.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-243" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-4-1-343x1024.png" alt="" width="343" height="1024" />

This email is great because it's actually an order confirmation email wrapped into a cross-sell email. They give the customer until the 9/10 (the date in the header of the email) to add more products to their cart before delivery.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry's use a similar approach by sending customers an up-sell email for one of their new products after the purchase of a shaver.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-242" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Picture-5-662x1024.jpg" alt="" width="662" height="1024" />

<b>Product recommendation emails </b>

<a href="https://www.smartrmail.com/auto-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product recommendation emails</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> let customers know about other products you have that may be of interest to them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of product recommendation emails is to </span><b>make customers aware of other products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The more products they buy, the more likely they are to buy them again, thus increasing your AOV and APF.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways you can set up these emails. The first is to include them in your transactional emails. In the email below, Amazon recommends books that other customers have bought who also bought an item the customer just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-241" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-6.png" alt="" width="564" height="956" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm sure this method increases Amazon's APF because they have millions of customers, and </span><a href="https://www.smartrmail.com/abandoned-cart-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abandoned cart emails with product recommendations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a higher conversion rate and AOV. But I recommend product recommendation emails that solely focus the entire message of the email on the product, instead of merging it with a transactional email. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If customers have to pay delivery charges, not many customers will immediately place a second order and pay a second handling charge. Also, there are two key messages in the email, diluting your product recommendation.   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on your APF, I'd much rather go ahead and send a bespoke email with a single message, like this Amazon email.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-240" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/product-recommendation-email.png" alt="" width="640" height="723" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon used these exact emails to generate not 1, but 3 board game purchases out of me. </span>

<b>Refill email</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A refill email is best suited for products that need to be ordered on a regular basis, typically consumable products. </span>

You want to time your refill emails approximately seven days before the customer is about to run out, as this gives them enough time to reorder and wait for shipping before they run out.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A refill email needs to offer the customer total convenience. Customers shouldn't have to trawl through your store, select their order quantity, and type in their details again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email should be straight to the point, giving the user a simple action to make with an added touch of urgency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This refill email from Rockin’ Wellness keeps it simple with a single call to action and no other elements that might distract the customer from the main goal of the email.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-239" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-9.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="914" />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this method on your most reordered items.</span>

<b>Win-back/reactivation emails</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent studies reveal that around </span><a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/email-activation-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of subscribers within an email list are currently inactive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-238" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-10.png" alt="" width="558" height="377" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inactive customers need to be removed from all email segments and placed into a win-back campaign with a tailored message. You can't send them product recommendation or broadcast emails because due to their order history, they clearly aren't working. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Duolingo, who offer online courses and sell language books, use the simple "</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We miss you"</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subject line to gain customers' attention again.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-236" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-11.png" alt="" width="680" height="689" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of email is okay to send, but it doesn't really offer the customer any incentive to try them again; and in my opinion, it is a little weak.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I much rather prefer using an offer in win-back emails, like Reebok, because it gives the customer an incentive to try your brand again.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-235" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-13.png" alt="" width="335" height="535" />

If you're not in the business of offering discounts, use a compelling and direct subject line like Duolingo. If that doesn't work, then consider following Reebok's route of offering a voucher or discount.

If both attempts fail, then there's little point keeping the customer on your email list as they will only negatively impact your email deliverability.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Manually remove them from your email list and send them a final email letting them know they have been removed and whether they want to be re-added.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-234" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-14.png" alt="" width="680" height="1014" />

<b>Retention and engagement </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The four email types above can all be automated based on customer behavior. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated emails are a must to drive sales, but I'm also a strong believer of using retention- and engagement-based emails to achieve the same thing.</span>

<b>Retention emails </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">are quite simply broadcast emails that you send when you have a new item in stock or run a promotion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's a Chewy email offering 30% off all American brands, which they sent to their list (this is not an automated email):</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-233" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-15-315x1024.png" alt="" width="315" height="1024" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teavana do the same, letting customers know about their new arrivals: </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-232" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/picture-16-456x1024.png" alt="" width="456" height="1024" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers love sales and want to know about new products in stock, so don't be afraid to let them know. You just have to be careful that you don't overload them with emails of every new item you get in stock.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the email frequency table to decide how many emails customers should receive each month.</span>

<b>Engagement and content emails</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aim to either educate your customer or provide them with value. The goal of engagement emails isn't to drive sales, but to keep engagement with customers and build stronger relationships, which as a secondary goal will end up driving more sales.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s an order arrival email from Harry’s:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-227 size-large" src="https://www.ordermetrics.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Order-Arrival-Email-Design-from-Harrys-379x1024.png" alt="" width="379" height="1024" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While each segment doesn’t directly sell a product, they no doubt lead into a natural (yet subtle) pitch for other products in Harry’s product line through product education.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers who are better educated about your brand and product benefits are more likely to stick around and order new things.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Your turn</b>

<a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/63321-companies-more-focused-on-acquisition-than-retention-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">44% of businesses focus more of their attention on customer acquisition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer acquisition is important to grow your business, but if you aren't following up with your new customers by using the email methods I've laid out above, your acquisition effort will be done in vain, as new customers will come in from one side and leave from the other. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your current email funnel and see where you can place more automated and broadcast emails to increase your customers' average order value and average purchase frequency. </span>
