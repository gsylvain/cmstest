<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are very excited to introduce our integration with WooCommerce on <a href="http://www.ordermetrics.io">OrderMetrics.io</a> and continue improving our features and integrations to help more eCommerce companies sustain profitability in their business. </span>
<h3><strong>What is OrderMetrics?</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like our Shopify integration, WooCommerce merchants can automatically pull in products and shipping costs for each of their orders and import this data into OrderMetrics.io. Our software takes this data and combines it with everything else required to run a merchant’s eCommerce store. From Facebook Ad Campaigns to Google Adwords to transaction fees to payroll, our clients are able to see their profitability in real-time.</span>

The open-source platform on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ordermetrics-io/">WooCommerce</a> is attractive to developers who want full control and flexibility on their site; however, with full control comes a higher learning curve. On the other hand, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/order-metrics-profit-analytics">Shopify</a> is a fully hosted platform which means users do not have to worry about installation, management, backups and performance.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever platform you use to market your eCommerce site, OrderMetrics.io strives to provide you with real-time data to track your numbers and help you remain profitable.
