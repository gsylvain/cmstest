Ah, whether to offer or not to offer Free Shipping. This is the million dollar question for many ecommerce companies looking to grow their business. We all know that shipping is never actually free (2016 was <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1483131600000&amp;chddm=98532&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;cmpto=NYSE:UPS&amp;cmptdms=0&amp;q=NYSE:FDX&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=h7ikWMGHPOqLeajCg_gE">a record year</a> for Fedex and UPS stock). However, the real question for store owners to ask themselves is "Does offering Free Shipping increase my conversion rate, customer loyalty, and repeat purchase rate enough to justify the cost?"

Unfortunately, we do not have a direct answer because it really depends on what types of products you sell, your business model, whether you ship internationally, and many other factors. However, we have created the following guide to help you determine whether it makes sense to offer Free Shipping for your Shopify, Magento, Woocommerce, or Bigcommerce store.
<h3><strong>Reasons to offer Free Shipping</strong></h3>
1) Free Shipping can help build brand loyalty

2) Free Shipping (could) increase your conversion rate

3) The Amazon Prime Effect

Amazon Prime has caused some customers to expect free shipping when they buy online.
<h3><strong>Reason not to offer Free Shipping</strong></h3>

A quick summary - shipping costs can be highly variable depending on where they are going, whats products were in an order (causing extra weight), and which method a package is sent.

<h3><strong>Alternatives to offering Free Shipping:</strong></h3>
1) Offer low flat rate shipping to offset the (low enough that it will not hurt your conversion rate on the checkout page)
2) Offer Free Shipping for orders over a certain dollar amount

However you must be careful that certain product combinations do not cause excessive shipping costs. <a href="http://www.ordermetrics.io">Order Metrics</a> can help you discover these orders.

3) Only offer Free Shipping on special occasions or during holiday promotions. This can boost sales without sacrificing your profit margin year round.

4) Offer a free shipping program to loyal customers

&nbsp;

The bottom line is that offering free shipping is an art and a science. You can use tools such as Optimizely to A/B test free shipping, but this data will never be 100% correct and it is difficult to attribute any conversion rate fluctuations with free shipping. Additionally, it may take a long time for the i

Our recommendation for new stores is to not offer Free Shipping on all orders, but rather test one of the alternatives we suggested and see if those recommendations work for them.
