It can be frustrating to know that customers are visiting your site and maybe even adding products to their cart but end up leaving without making a purchase. Lucky Orange is a Shopify app that helps you discover <em>why </em>your customers are leaving withut making a purchase. They do this by capturing a video recording of each visitor interacting with your website. Watching a recording of your visitors helps you discover where they get stuck, confused, or turned off by pricing.

In addition to video recordings, they offer vistor surveys, heatmaps and live chat, however we have only tested out their video recording feature.

The Lucky Orange Shopify app is affordable, comes with a <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/lucky-orange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free 7-day trial</a>, and it’s a no-brainer to give it a try.

<strong>2) <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/order-metrics-profit-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Order Metrics</a> - Monitor and improve your store's </strong><b>profitability</b>

Staying on top of your costs is an essential task to run a successful ecommerce store and unfortunately Shopify does not offer proper reporting tools to manage your store’s costs or profit. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.OrderMetrics.io">OrderMetrics.io</a> has created an excellent app that helps you analyze your store’s profitability at the product and order level. It sits somewhere between an ERP and an accounting system – giving you a detailed view of where your store is and is not making profit.

As veteran store owners have likely experienced, it can be difficult to keep track of your Cost of Goods, discounts/promotions, shipping costs, and Facebook/Google Adwords spend when the data is scattered across multiple channels. Order Metrics combines this data into a single dashboard that shows overall profitability in real time. This makes Order Metrics it an extremely useful tool for store’s who want to spend less time organizing data and more time making improvements and finding new customers.

Order Metrics comes with a <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/order-metrics-profit-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free trial</a> and requires very little setup to get started.
